## Project Description

Clean and prepare the FIFA19 players dataset to visualize the data. 
Create different visualizations to extract information from the data.

<a name="dataset"></a>

## Dataset
The dataset is from Kaggle. It's a dataset of the detailed attributes for every player registered in the latest edition of FIFA 19 database.

## Workflow

### Find a dataset
* I tried different datasets, but some needed to much work cleaning to be able to use it.
* Finally I chosed the FIFA19 Players data from the FIFA19 videogame. With data from more than 18k soccer players over the World at Kaggle.

### Cleaning and setting the data
* I spent a little bit of the time of the project cleaning and setting the data to be able to visualize.

### Visualization

* I have used the dataset create differnt types of graphs for the visualization.

## Results

A serties of graphs are the result of the Project. As well as the project, to be presented in class.

Some more graphs have been added for the purpose of the class presentation.

## Obstacles

I think the difficulty is to be able to find my own objective into the data, as the project is open and the possibilities to create graphs are infinite.

## Lessons Learned

* I have learned to choose more wisely a dataset, and what I can expect from a certain dataset from Kaggle.
* I have leaned that the cleaning is and will always be part of the project, whatever the aim of the project.
* I have leaned (a littel bit more) to choose the graph to be used depending on the data.
